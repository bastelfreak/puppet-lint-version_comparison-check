A puppet-lint plugin to check for versions compared as numbers.

## Checks

### Version compared as number

Versions should be managed as strings, and compared using the `versioncmp()` function.

Not doing so will fail with the future parser starting with Puppet 3.7.4.

#### What you have done

```puppet
if $version >= 4 { }
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
if versioncmp($version, '4') >= 0 { }
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-version_comparison-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-version_comparison-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_version_comparison')
```
